# ðŸ§ª Lab 1 â€“ Explore False Positives Through Incident Detection

---

## Overview

In this lab, I explored how **false positives** occur during incident detection in Google Cloud.  
Using **Security Command Center (SCC)**, I generated and analyzed a finding related to **user-managed service account keys**.  
By creating a service account, generating a key, triggering a detection, and finally remediating it, I learned to identify which alerts are legitimate threats and which are expected behaviors.

---

## Objectives

- Understand how a false positive appears in **Security Command Center (SCC)**.  
- Simulate a suspicious IAM action by creating and using a service account key.  
- Classify the alert correctly as a false positive.  
- Remediate the issue by deleting the key and restoring compliance.

## Tools & Services Used

- **Google Cloud Console**  
  - IAM & Admin â†’ Service Accounts  
  - Security â†’ Security Command Center (SCC)  
- **gcloud CLI** for authentication testing  
- Two Google Cloud **student accounts**  
  - *Account A*: Generates the false positive  
  - *Account B*: Investigates and remediates it

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1 â€“ Create a Service Account

I created a new service account (`test-account`) using **IAM & Admin â†’ Service Accounts**.  
This account is used to generate a benign IAM key that SCC will flag as suspicious.

### Task 2 â€“ Generate and Download a JSON Key

I added a new **user-managed key** for the service account and downloaded the **JSON file**.  
This action simulates potentially risky behavior that can be detected by SCC.

### Task 3 â€“ Trigger the Finding (Activate the Key)

Using Cloud Shell, I authenticated with the new service account key:

```bash
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=<keyfilename>.json
```
This activation confirmed the keyâ€™s validity and triggered a **User-managed service account key** finding in **Security Command Center (SCC)**.

**ðŸ“¸ Evidence:**

### Task 4 â€“ Switch to the Analyst Account

I logged out from *Account A* and into *Account B* to simulate the separation between the user generating the event and the analyst investigating it.  
This separation prevents bias and mirrors standard **Security Operations Center (SOC)** procedures.

  
**ðŸ“¸ Evidence:**

### Task 5 â€“ Investigate the Finding in SCC

In **Security Command Center (SCC)**, I filtered findings for **IAM â†’ User-managed service account key**.  
The detection appeared as expected. I examined timestamps, principal email, and key usage details to confirm that this was the lab-generated activity â€” a **false positive**.

**ðŸ“¸ Evidence:**

### Task 6 â€“ Remediate by Deleting the Key

To close the incident, I deleted the **user-managed key** from the service account.  
This action removed unnecessary access credentials, cleared the finding in SCC, and restored the environment to a secure state.

## Summary & Key Takeaways

- **False positives** are inevitable in any detection system; context and investigation define their meaning.  
- **SCC** effectively detects high-risk IAM actions, like service account key creation.  
- **Analysts must validate intent** â€” not every flagged action is malicious.  
- Enforcing **least privilege** and avoiding user-managed keys reduces alert noise.  
- Separating activity creation and analysis mirrors real-world SOC investigation practices.

## Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how to identify and remediate **false positives** in **Google Cloud Security Command Center**.  
By creating, analyzing, and resolving a user-managed service account key finding, I learned to differentiate between legitimate administrative actions and potential threats.  
The exercise reinforced practical SOC skills â€” **accurate classification, contextual analysis, and effective remediation**.
