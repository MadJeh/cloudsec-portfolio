# ðŸ§  Lab 1 â€“ Module 3: Analyze Audit Logs Using BigQuery  
**Course:** 1303 (Path 419 â€“ Security in the Cloud)  
**Role:** Junior Cloud Security Analyst, Cymbal Bank  
**Duration:** ~1 h 30 min  

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
In this lab, I acted as a cloud security analyst investigating suspicious activity within Google Cloud.  
Two users simulated an incident: **User 1** created and deleted resources, while **User 2** (the investigator) used Cloud Audit Logs and BigQuery to trace the malicious actions.  
The lab demonstrates how to identify, export, and analyze administrative events using Google Cloudâ€™s native security and logging tools.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Generate audit-log activity by creating and deleting cloud resources.  
- Export Cloud Audit Logs to BigQuery through a logging sink.  
- Perform forensic analysis using Logs Explorer filters.  
- Query audit data in BigQuery with SQL to identify who deleted which resources.  

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Services Used
- **Cloud Shell** â€“ command-line execution and resource creation  
- **Cloud Logging / Logs Explorer** â€“ real-time log inspection  
- **Log Router / Sink** â€“ export pipeline to BigQuery  
- **BigQuery** â€“ SQL-based audit-log analysis  
- **IAM & Audit Logs** â€“ identity attribution (`principalEmail`)  
- **Compute Engine & Cloud Storage** â€“ resources used for simulation

## ðŸ§© Task Breakdown

### **Task 1 â€“ Generate Account Activity**
Created a Cloud Storage bucket, uploaded a file, created a VPC network + VM, and deleted the bucket to generate Admin Activity logs.

### **Task 2 â€“ Export Audit Logs to BigQuery**
Configured a log sink named `AuditLogsExport` to route new Cloud Audit Logs to a BigQuery dataset (`auditlogs_dataset`).

---

### **Task 3 â€“ Generate More Activity**
Created two buckets and deleted a Compute Engine VM to ensure fresh logs were exported after sink creation.

### **Task 4 â€“ Sign in as Investigator**
Switched to User 2 to preserve chain of custody and analyze logs as an independent account.

### **Task 5 â€“ Analyze Admin Activity Logs**
Used Logs Explorer to filter `storage.googleapis.com` and `storage.buckets.delete` events, confirming that User 1 deleted the buckets.

---

### **Task 6 â€“ Analyze Audit Logs in BigQuery**
Queried exported logs using SQL to identify VM and bucket deletions, displaying timestamps, resource names, and principal emails.  

**Sample Queries Used**
```sql
-- VM deletion
SELECT timestamp, resource.labels.instance_id,
       protopayload_auditlog.authenticationInfo.principalEmail,
       protopayload_auditlog.methodName
FROM `auditlogs_dataset.cloudaudit_googleapis_com_activity_*`
WHERE protopayload_auditlog.methodName = "v1.compute.instances.delete";

-- Bucket deletion
SELECT timestamp, resource.labels.bucket_name,
       protopayload_auditlog.authenticationInfo.principalEmail,
       protopayload_auditlog.methodName
FROM `auditlogs_dataset.cloudaudit_googleapis_com_activity_*`
WHERE protopayload_auditlog.methodName = "storage.buckets.delete";
```

## ðŸ§¾ Summary & Key Takeaways

**Audit Logs = Accountability:** Every administrative action is traceable to a principal email.  

**Log Sinks = Persistence:** Exporting to BigQuery ensures long-term retention and query power.  

**Forensics = Cross-validation:** Logs Explorer is for real-time inspection; BigQuery is for structured investigation.  

**Security Posture:** Cloud Audit Logs are critical for detecting resource tampering and confirming root cause of incidents.

## ðŸ§© Conclusion

This lab demonstrated end-to-end incident analysis on Google Cloud.  
By generating activity, exporting logs, and performing SQL-based forensic queries, I validated the integrity of Cymbal Bankâ€™s audit pipeline.  
These skills directly translate to real-world SOC operations â€” establishing visibility, detecting unauthorized actions, and enabling rapid incident response.
