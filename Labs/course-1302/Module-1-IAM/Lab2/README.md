# ðŸ”¥ Lab 2 â€“ Access a Firewall and Create a Rule

## ðŸ“š Overview

In this lab, I learned how to protect a web server in Google Cloud by managing **firewall rules**, generating network traffic, and analyzing **VPC Flow Logs**.

### âœ… Task 1 â€“ Create Firewall Rule

Created a rule to **allow traffic** on HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22), limited to VMs tagged `http-server`.

ðŸ“¸ Evidence:

### âœ… Task 2 â€“ Generate HTTP Network Traffic

Connected to the Apache web server using its **external IP** to simulate HTTP traffic.

### âœ… Task 3 â€“ Analyze Flow Logs

Used **Logs Explorer** to search VPC Flow Logs by my IP, verifying HTTP traffic was allowed.

ðŸ“¸ Evidence:

### âœ… Task 4 â€“ Create Deny Rule for HTTP

Created a new firewall rule to **deny HTTP (port 80)** traffic from all sources to the tagged VM.

ðŸ“¸ Evidence:  
![Deny Rule Created](./Screenshots_Lab2/07_Deny_HTTP_Rule_Created.png)

### âœ… Task 5 â€“ Verify Denied Traffic in Logs

Tried reconnecting to the web server and confirmed access was denied. Checked logs to validate.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to configure and **apply custom firewall rules** in Google Cloud
- Using **target tags** to limit rule scope to specific VM instances
- **Monitoring traffic logs** via Logs Explorer
- The difference between **allowed** and **denied** dispositions
- Basics of **perimeter protection** and why firewall rules are important
