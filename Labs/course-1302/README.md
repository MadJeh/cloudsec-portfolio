# üß™ Module 1 Lab ‚Äì Google Cloud IAM Role Creation

## üîç Scenario

As part of Cymbal Bank‚Äôs cloud migration, sensitive customer data stored in Firebase requires restricted access for third-party auditors. As a junior cloud security analyst, your task is to securely configure a **custom IAM role** that grants **read-only** permissions, and assign it to a specific audit team user.
