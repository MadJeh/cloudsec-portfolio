# 🧪 Lab 1 – Web Application Vulnerabilities and Remediation Techniques

## 📝 Overview

In this lab, I worked as a **Security Analyst** to find and fix a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability in a web application. I deployed a vulnerable Python Flask app on a Google Cloud VM, tested it with an injection, scanned it using **Web Security Scanner (WSS)**, fixed the vulnerability in the code, and re-scanned to confirm the remediation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Deploy a vulnerable Flask web app on Google Cloud.
- Simulate a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to confirm the vulnerability.
- Use **Web Security Scanner** to scan the application.
- Remediate the vulnerability with proper input sanitization.
- Re-run the scan to validate the fix.

## 🔎 Task Breakdown

### 🧩 Task 1 – Launch a Virtual Machine

I created a VM on Google Cloud with no service account or additional scopes, then reserved a **static IP**. I also installed `python3-flask` using a startup script.

📸 **Evidence:**  

VM successfully created:

Static IP generated for external access:

VM instance confirmation from Compute Engine:

### 🔐 Task 2 – Set Up and Run the Vulnerable Application

I created a **firewall rule** to allow traffic on port `8080`, connected to the VM via SSH, downloaded the vulnerable Flask app, and started the server.

📸 **Evidence:**  

Firewall rule created to allow HTTP traffic:

SSH connection established:

### 💥 Task 3 – Test for XSS Vulnerability

I accessed the web application using the static IP and port `8080` and tested for an XSS vulnerability by injecting the following payload:

```html
<script>alert('This is an XSS Injection to demonstrate one of OWASP vulnerabilities')</script>
```

The appearance of a JavaScript `alert()` popup confirmed the vulnerability.

📸 **Evidence:**  

Web form accessed and ready for injection:

XSS payload triggered successfully:

### 🔍 Task 4 – Scan the Application Using Web Security Scanner

I enabled the **Web Security Scanner API**, created a scan configuration for the target, and ran the scan. Logs showed scan execution and detection of the XSS vulnerability.

📸 **Evidence:**  

Web Security Scanner API enabled:

Scan configuration created for the target:

Scan logs monitored via SSH terminal:

XSS vulnerability detected in the scan report:  
![WSS XSS Found](./Lab1-WebApp-Vulnerability/Screenshots_Lab1/14_WSS_XSS_Found.png)

---

### 🛠️ Task 5 – Remediate the XSS Vulnerability

I edited the `app.py` file to sanitize user input and escape HTML characters before rendering the output:

```python
output_string = "".join([html_escape_table.get(c, c) for c in input_string])
# output_string = input_string
```

After saving the changes, I restarted the Flask app to apply the fix.

📸 **Evidence:**  

Sanitization fix implemented in the code:

Application restarted with fixed code:  
![ReRun Fixed App](./Lab1-WebApp-Vulnerability/Screenshots_Lab1/16_ReRun_Fixed_App.png)

---

### 🔁 Task 6 – Re-scan the Application

I launched a new scan to verify that the vulnerability had been fixed. The scan started successfully, but the lab expired before capturing the final “no vulnerabilities” screen.

📸 **Evidence:**  

Re-scan launched after remediation:
