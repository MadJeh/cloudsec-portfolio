# Cloud Security Portfolio — Starter

This repo is a starter skeleton for your **Always Free** Google Cloud labs aligned to Path 419 (Courses 1300 → 1305) and ACE prep.

## Structure
- `docs/` — guides, lab journals, reports
- `logs/` — CSV exports (e.g., SCC triage log, IAM matrix)
- `scripts/` — helper scripts (gcloud)
- `diagrams/` — PNG/draw.io diagrams
- `dm/` — Deployment Manager templates
- `portfolio/` — organized artifacts by course/topic
- `evidence/` — drop screenshots here (by week/day)

## Quick Start
1. Create your GCP lab project and set budget alerts (Week 1).
2. Commit screenshots into `evidence/` folders per checklist.
3. Track progress using the checklists in `docs/checklists/` (printable).

> Guardrail: **Do not enable VPC Flow Logs or Firewall Rule Logging** (billable network telemetry). Keep within free-tier quotas.
