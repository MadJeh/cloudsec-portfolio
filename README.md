## 🧩 Projects Overview

### 🔐 Identify & Protect — Course 1302

This section contains hands-on labs focused on **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**, **vulnerability assessment**, and **secure infrastructure deployment** using Google Cloud.

---

#### 🧩 Module 1 — IAM (Identity & Access Management)
Explored Google Cloud IAM roles, service accounts, and least-privilege principles.  
Key tasks:
- Created and managed **custom IAM roles** for fine-grained access control  
- Implemented **principle of least privilege** across resources  
- Tested permissions and verified **policy bindings** using the `gcloud` CLI  
- Captured audit logs for IAM activity verification  

📂 Folder: [`Labs/course-1302/Module-1-IAM`](./Labs/course-1302/Module-1-IAM)

---

#### 🧩 Module 2 — Vulnerability Management
Performed vulnerability identification and remediation on a cloud web application.  
Key tasks:
- Configured and executed scans using **Web Security Scanner**  
- Detected **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** and other injection vulnerabilities  
- Fixed public exposure and validated security with a re-scan  
- Linked findings to **Security Command Center (SCC)** for centralized visibility

---

#### 🧩 Module 3 — Secure Infrastructure with Terraform
Applied **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles using **Terraform** to enforce consistent and secure resource configurations.  
Key tasks:
- Built and deployed **VPC networks, subnets, and firewall rules** via Terraform  
- Applied security guardrails in configuration files (no public IPs, minimal open ports)  
- Validated compliance and reproducibility of infrastructure  
- Created a **Terraform Security Checklist** for future automation projects  

📂 Folder: [`Labs/course-1302/Module-3-Terraform`](./Labs/course-1302/Module-3-Terraform)


Each of these modules aligns with the **Protect** and **Identify** phases of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**, strengthening both access control and foundational cloud security posture.

### ⚙️ Detect & Respond — Course 1303

This course focuses on **threat detection**, **incident investigation**, **log analysis**, and **response actions** using Google Cloud tools such as **Chronicle**, **Security Command Center**, **BigQuery**, and **Google Backup & DR**.

---

#### 🧩 Module 1 — Threat Detection
Configured detection mechanisms and analyzed simulated security events in Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC).  
Key tasks:
- Identified alerts generated by SCC and explored finding categories  
- Used **Chronicle SIEM** to investigate indicators of compromise (IOCs)  
- Mapped detection activity to **MITRE ATT&CK** tactics  
- Practiced interpreting real-time threat events and determining severity  

📂 Folder: [`Labs/course-1303/Module_1_threat_detection`](./Labs/course-1303/Module_1_threat_detection)

---

#### 🧩 Module 2 — Explore False Positives Through Incident Investigation
Investigated suspicious activity to separate true positives from false positives in Chronicle.  
Key tasks:
- Used **Chronicle Unified Data Model** to filter and classify events  
- Examined DNS and HTTP activity to confirm or dismiss alerts  
- Applied analytical queries to validate suspicious IPs and domains  
- Documented incident triage outcomes and escalation logic  

📂 Folder: [`Labs/course-1303/Module_2_Explore_false_positives_through_incident_investigation`](./Labs/course-1303/Module_2_Explore_false_positives_through_incident_investigation)

---

#### 🧩 Module 3 — Analyze Audit Logs Using BigQuery
Performed forensic log analysis on Google Cloud audit logs with **BigQuery** to uncover patterns of compromise.  
Key tasks:
- Queried **Cloud Audit Logs** for user activity and privilege escalation  
- Identified unauthorized API calls and potential insider threats  
- Built custom SQL queries for automated detection  
- Exported filtered results and visualized trends in query output

---

#### 🧩 Module 4 — Recover VMs with Google Backup & DR
Executed post-incident recovery actions to restore compromised resources and verify system integrity.  
Key tasks:
- Used **Google Backup & DR** to snapshot and restore affected VMs  
- Validated that restored machines were malware-free before redeployment  
- Re-applied hardened firewall configurations  
- Verified compliance and updated Chronicle’s incident record for closure  

📂 Folder: [`Labs/course-1303/Module_4_Recover_VMs_with_Google_Backup&DR`](./Labs/course-1303/Module_4_Recover_VMs_with_Google_Backup&DR)

---

Each of these modules aligns with the **Detect**, **Respond**, and **Recover** phases of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**, demonstrating operational readiness and hands-on incident response in the Google Cloud environment.
---

### 🧱 Capstone Project — Respond & Recover
Simulated a real-world data breach at **Cymbal Bank**, then executed remediation actions to restore compliance and security posture.  
Steps performed:
1. Analyzed **Security Command Center (SCC)** findings  
2. Shut down the infected VM and restored from a secure snapshot  
3. Revoked **public bucket access** and enforced **uniform bucket-level control**  
4. Cleaned up **firewall rules** and enabled logging  
5. Verified remediation by running a **CIS 2.0 compliance report** with zero active findings
